# Junk Converter

Manual version: manual_stable_20241119

Most Manual worlds have more locations than meaningful items. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but due to the way Manuals work, keeping track of filler items is not always fun or worth it. Even if you have a way to grant yourself e.g. five dollars or five experience points, you may not want to manually do so over and over.

Thus, this meta world exists to minimize the amount of junk/filler items in other Manual worlds. It's called the Junk Coverter because it converts some items that would otherwise be junk into Storage Keys, which unlock Storage Rooms.

__This world will never generate on its own__, as it has far more progression items than locations. At present, the number of items and locations are hardcoded, so you will need to edit the numbers to suit your particular multiworld. Using YAML options to specify e.g. number of keys, rooms, and keys required per-room are TBD.
