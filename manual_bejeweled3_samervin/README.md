# Bejeweled 3

- Locations: All levels of most badges. (Additional levels/milestones for certain modes?)
    - I skipped the badges Inferno, Stellar, Chromatic, and The Gambler, which are grindy and require little skill.
    - I marked with asterisks the four badges that I did not personally achieve while playing casually. Ice Breaker gold and platinum badges are well-known to be very difficult. I am not good at poker so I never earned Ante Up gold or platinum. I left them in the list for now, but I may take them out or lean into "skip" items.
- Items: (Badge items? Location unlocks? Skip items?)
- Victory: ???
- Notes: Compare with the existing Bejeweled 3 manual

### What are the locations?

Each badge is four locations, one each for bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. (A few grindy badges are not included: Inferno, Stellar, Chromatic, Gambler.)

Classic and Zen modes have additional checks for completing levels 4, 8, and 12.

Quest mode has additional checks for revealing each relic (4/8 quests) and restoring each relic (all 8 quests).

### What are the items?

Each game mode has an associated item, which enables access to that mode's locations.

All 40 jewels placed into relics in Quest mode are items. Multiples of 8 jewels are required to complete each relic and finish Quest mode.
