# Bejeweled 3

- Locations: All levels of most badges. (Additional levels/milestones for certain modes?)
    - I skipped the badges Inferno, Stellar, Chromatic, and The Gambler, which are grindy and require little skill.
    - I marked with asterisks the four badges that I did not personally achieve while playing casually. Ice Breaker gold and platinum badges are well-known to be very difficult. I am not good at poker so I never earned Ante Up gold or platinum. I left them in the list for now, but I may take them out or lean into "skip" items.
- Items: (Badge items? Location unlocks? Skip items?)
- Notes: Compare with the existing Bejeweled 3 manual
