Tony Hawk

- THPS3
    - Locations: Goal items (SKATE, tape, deck, stats); Goal completion (9 per normal level); Level completion (9 per skater); Career completion
    - Items: "Keys" to unlock levels; Goal items; Trick types
    - Notes: Could be combined with existing THPS3 randomizer to open all levels. Locking items or trick types behind flags is doable but complex.
- THUG
    - Locations: Missions
    - Items: "Keys" to unlock levels/chapters; Trick types
    - Notes: This is only meaningful if missions can be replayed on a completed save file, which I believe is possible. I think secret tape/level unlocks are permanently gone once collected so those wouldn't be possible on a completed save file. THUG can likely be modded on PC similarly to THPS3, but I have not done so myself.
- THPS 1+2
    - Locations: Goal items; Goal completion, Level completion
    - Items: "Keys" to unlock levels; Goal items; Trick types
    - Notes: While you can reset story progress for custom skaters, the better approach is probably Speedrun mode, which allows you to do any regular level again in any order. You can limit yourself to 2 minutes at a time for individual goals.

Open-ended matrix/spreadsheet games

- 20 Minutes Till Dawn
    - Locations: Matrix of (a subset of) character, weapon, level, etc.
    - Items: Characters, weapons, levels, runes, perks, tomes
    - Notes: Easy to do with a completed save file, the challenge would be balancing build flexibility with location and item counts
- Mini Motorways
    - Tourist/Commuter/Driver (400/1000/2000) on normal, 3x Challenger (600), Expert (500), Endless milestones (?) for all 21 cities
    - Items: Cities, upgrades (motorways, bridges, tunnels, roundabouts, traffic lights), game speed
    - Notes: I have not completed Driver or Expert on most maps so I might start without those. I think Commuter/1000 should be fine with no upgrades. Not sure what a good level for Endless would be.

Elder Scrolls

- Oblivion
    - Locations: Quest completion; Finding location markers; Varla Stones; Welkynd Stones
    - Items: Skills; Item qualities (e.g. Iron); Item slots (e.g. boots); Weapon types (e.g. dagger); Experience/levels; Other items (alchemy equipment, soul gems, lockpicks, repair hammers)
    - Notes: Always start with an offensive skill: Blade, Blunt, Hand-to-Hand, Marksman, Conjuration, or Destruction. Ignore Athletics and Acrobatics as they will automatically level up no matter what. Not permitted to use skills you don't have. Custom character (race, gender, birthsign, class) should probably be chosen to maximize your starting skill(s) but can be randomized if desired. Console commands can be used to grant yourself items, spells, and skill levels (among more esoteric things) and so these are great filler items.
- Skyrim
    - Locations: Quest completion; Finding location markers;
    - Items: Skills; Item qualities (e.g. iron); Item slots (e.g. boots); Weapon types (e.g. dagger); Experience/levels; Other items (alchemy equipment, soul gems, lockpicks)
    - Notes: Always start with an offensive skill: Conjuration, Destruction, Archery, One-handed, Two-handed. Not permitted to use skills you don't have. Custom character (race, gender) should probably be chosen to maximize your starting skill(s) but can be randomized if desired. Console commands can be used to grant yourself items, spells, and skill levels (among more esoteric things) and so these are great filler items.

Other

- Crash Bandicoot 2
    - Locations: 25 crystals; 25 + 2 clear box gems; 15 special gems; 27 x 3 relic times; 5 bosses
    - Items: Crystals; gems; movement options; vehicles; warp rooms
    - Notes: To mirror the vanilla game, could simply be a crystal hunt: 5 crystals unlocks a boss, and all 25 lets you fight Cortex and finish the game. Can be played from a completed file with an arbitrary life count, or you can just beat the game on a fresh save in less than 2 hours if you ignore the secrets. Movement rando seems plausible, specifically spin, slide/crouch, slide jump, and body slam are probably not all needed for all levels.
- Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga
    - Locations: 36x level gold brick, True Jedi gold brick, 10 minikits + gold brick, red brick, 10 blue canisters; bonus levels and bounty hunter missions
    - Items: Level/episode access; Gold bricks; Minikits; Red bricks; Blue canisters; Characters
    - Notes: Can use Cheat Engine to modify memory/save data in order to unlock levels, characters, etc. A save file with all levels "completed" in Story mode but no collectables found is doable, then create logic for the characters needed to beat the level and find all the minikit parts.
- shapez 2
    - Locations: Produce some number of randomly generated shapez
    - Items: Each of the available tools, platforms, trains, wires, etc.
    - Notes: Likely relies on a custom campaign to make operator levels trivial and spawn more types of shapez. Not sure if the hub remembers the quantity of a delivered shape unless it is needed for a quest.
