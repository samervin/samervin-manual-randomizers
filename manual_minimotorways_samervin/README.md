# Mini Motorways

- Manual version: Stable 20241119
- Item count: 118 unique, 139 total
- Location count: 127 total

Getting started:
- You are assumed to have access to all modes on all cities.
    - If you don't, the quickest route to unlocking everything is to get a score of 1000+ on each city. That will unlock all the remaining cities as well as the challenges for each city.
    - You do need to reach 600 in a challenge to access expert mode for that city, but you always logically unlock challenges and expert mode simultaneously in this world, so simply do the challenge first.
- You start with 3 random maps, which unlock those cities for play.
- You start with no upgrades except for starting items on those cities. See below.

Locations:
- Tourist (400), Commuter (1000), and Driver (2000) milestones in classic mode for all maps
- Challenge milestones (600) for all challenges, 1-3 per map
- Expert milestone (500) in expert mode on all maps

Items:
- Maps unlock that city for playing. You start with 3 random maps.
- For classic mode: motorways, bridges, tunnels, roundabouts, and traffic lights are locked behind items.
    - You may use any items provided at the start of the map, i.e. you often start with one bridge.
    - Motorways, bridges, and tunnels are all logically required for the Driver (2000) milestone, but feel free to try to complete it early.
- Challenges and expert mode have no item locks, so play those as normal.

Victory:
- There are 22 identical Golden Car items in the world, one for every city. Once you collect 14, you win immediately.

Notes:
- Endless mode has zero locations. The mode is not designed to be difficult, and milestones in other modes can be continued in Endless, which is cute but leads to location bloat.

# TODO

- Different approaches to items
    - Rather than a binary on/off, have individual +1s, e.g. 1 bridge, 2 motorways, 3 traffic lights available
    - Rather than specifying upgrade options, simply add weeks, i.e. 3 weeks in Busan means you can use the first 3 upgrades you see. This could optionally be applied to challenge and expert modes as well
- Some cities cannot be realistically completed, even the 400 and 1000 milestones, with their starting items. For example, Dar es Salaam does not start you with a bridge. Here are the starting items, with some in-progress notes on whether the 400 and 1000 milestones can be completed:
    - Los Angeles: 1 bridge
    - Beijing: 1 bridge
    - Tokyo: 2 bridges (1000 trips with 2 bridges is difficult.)
    - London: 2 bridges
    - Mumbai: 1 bridge
    - New York City: 2 bridges
    - Dar es Salaam: 1 roundabout (400 is not reasonable with no bridges. 1000 trips with just 1 bridge is doable.)
    - Moscow: 1 bridge
    - Munich: 2 bridges
    - Zurich: 1 bridge + 1 tunnel
    - Manila: 2 bridges
    - Rio de Janeiro: 1 bridge + 1 tunnel
    - Dubai: 2 bridges
    - Mexico City: 1 roundabout
    - Wellington: 1 tunnel
    - Warsaw: 2 bridges
    - Chiang Mai: 3 bridges
    - Lisbon: 2 traffic lights
    - Busan: 2 bridges
    - Reykjavik: 2 traffic lights
    - Vancouver: 1 motorway
    - Cairns: 1 bridge + 1 tunnel
