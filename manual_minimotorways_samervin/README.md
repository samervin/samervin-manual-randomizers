# Mini Motorways

Manual version: Stable 20241119

Getting started:
- You are assumed to have access to all modes on all cities.
    - If you don't, the quickest route to unlocking everything is to get a score of 1000+ on each city. That will unlock all the remaining cities as well as the challenges for each city.
    - You do need to reach 600 in a challenge to access expert mode for that city, but you always logically unlock challenges and expert mode simultaneously in this world, so simply do the challenge first.
- You start with 3 random maps, which unlock those cities for play.
- You start with no upgrades except for starting items on those cities. See below.

Locations:
- Tourist (400), Commuter (1000), and Driver (2000) milestones in classic mode for all maps
- Endless mode milestones for all maps
- Challenge milestones (600) for all challenges, 1-3 per map
- Expert milestone (500) in expert mode on all maps

Items:
- Maps unlock that city for playing. You start with 3 random maps.
- For classic and endless modes: motorways, bridges, tunnels, roundabouts, and traffic lights are locked behind items.
    - You may use any items provided at the start of the map, i.e. you usually start with one bridge.
    - Motorways, bridges, and tunnels are all logically required for the Driver (2000) milestone, but feel free to go for it out of logic.
    - Challenges and expert mode have no item locks, so play those as normal.

Victory:
- There are 21 identical Golden Car items in the world, one for every city. Once you collect 14, you win immediately.

# TODO

- YAML option to disable Endless milestones
- Reduce Endless to Milestone 15 (around 2000 trips in Classic)
- Down Under Update featuring Cairns, Australia. (Bridges and tunnels, challenge named "Infrastructure Planning")
