# Mini Motorways

- Locations: Tourist/Commuter/Driver (400/1000/2000) on classic, 1-3x Challenger (600), Expert (500), Endless milestones (?) for all 21 cities
- Items: Cities, upgrades (motorways, bridges, tunnels, roundabouts, traffic lights), game speed
- Notes: I have not completed Driver or Expert on most maps so I might start without those. I think Commuter/1000 should be fine with no upgrades. Not sure what a good level for Endless would be.
