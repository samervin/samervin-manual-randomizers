# Tony Hawk's Underground

- Each story mission is a location
- Each of the 27 story chapters has an item required to unlock it
- You win when you Tear Up Eric's Best Line after unlocking chapter 27
- It is recommended to beat the story on Easy or Normal first, then use the completed save file to replay missions as needed
    - Sick is technically possible but it's very difficult to complete certain missions
- TODO: THUG lets you turn off certain trick types from the pause menu, so e.g. manuals and walking could be locked behind items
- TODO: Special tricks/slots could be locked behind items
- Note: Secret tape and level collectables disappear once collected, so they are not locations
- Note: Side missions that unlock special trick slots cannot be replayed, so they are not locations
