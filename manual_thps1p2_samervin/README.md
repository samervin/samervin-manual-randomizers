# Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2

Implementation notes:
- For career levels, speedrun mode is recommended
- For competition levels, replaying them in story is recommended
    - TODO Record medal scores so that single session mode can be used
- You need a level's ticket in order to access that level
- Each regular career level has 10 goal locations
- Each competition career level has 3 medal locations
- The two secret levels have TODO locations
- You start with 1 stat in all categories and can find the other 90 stat points
- Game mods unfortunately cannot be toggled in speedrun mode, so you cannot use the Legacy THPS modes to make the game harder, nor can you turn on cheats to make the game easier
- TODO Lock special tricks/slots behind items
- TODO Choose whether to lock additional trick types behind items (manuals, reverts, transfers, grinds, flips, grabs, wallplants, etc.)
- TODO Determine which goals, if any, cannot be done with 1 stat
- TODO Victory when you get a gold on both Roswell and Bullring
