# Burnout Paradise

Notes
- Intended to be played using the Remastered version
- You can force the game to make a new save file by renaming or deleting `%APPDATALOCAL%\Criterion Games\Burnout Paradise Remastered\Save\Profile.BurnoutParadiseSave`. I renamed mine to `Profile.BurnoutParadiseSave.Backup`.
- Playing on a completed file is possible, as you can retry events at will. The events will all be in their hardest mode though, and the road rules are difficult to track as the timer stops running if you go over your previous time.
- The game does track things like billboards and jumps, but I think that's too much hassle. The regular events are all clearly visible on the map and easy to find, and there are already a lot of locations.
- Unlocking a car gives you the ability to use it if it is in your garage. There is no way I know of to grant yourself a car without playing on a completed file or using mods, which I have not personally tried.
- Getting a new license resets all completed events. There is no good way of noting this in-game, so use the tracker to find events.
- Except for the burning routes, the vanilla game does not put any requirements on any events.
- To limit the size of sphere 1, the six major areas of the map will be locked behind maps. You can still drive through locked areas and complete events that finish there, but you cannot (logically) start events there.
- In future, I may logically lock certain location types behind additional items, e.g. road rules may require an item to complete. I don't think I will want regional event type locks though, i.e. "Races in Downtown Paradise only". I'm OK with relatively few locking items / large spheres as this game is very open-world and the events are not especially difficult.
- Best guide for listing all cars and events is here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2291470178
- Any events marked with a ??? have not been confirmed in-game

Locations:
- 40 races + 4-6 DLC (what do the Tours count as?)
- 16 road rage + 3 DLC
- 15 marked man + 2 DLC
- 14 stunt run + 3 DLC
- 64 time road rules + 12 DLC
- 64 showtime road rules + 12 DLC
- 19 bike burning rides
- 19 bike midnight rides
- 64 bike day road rules + 12 DLC
- 64 bike night road rules + 12 DLC
- 35 burning routes + 1 DLC
    - These are not included right now. They require the base car to complete, and unless you are playing on a completed file it takes a long time to get late-game cars.

Items:
- 6 maps, to complete events in different areas
    - 2 additional map items for Auto Repair and Gas Station drive-throughs
- 70 cars + 6 carbon cars
- 4 bikes + 1 toy
- 33 PCPD variant cars
- 23 other DLC cars (legendary, toys, specials, Big Surf Island)
