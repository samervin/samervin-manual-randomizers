# Burnout Paradise

Notes
- Intended to be played using the Remastered version
- You can force the game to make a new save file by renaming or deleting `%APPDATALOCAL%\Criterion Games\Burnout Paradise Remastered\Save\Profile.BurnoutParadiseSave`. I renamed mine to `Profile.BurnoutParadiseSave.Backup`.
- Playing on a completed file is possible, as you can retry events at will. The events will all be in their hardest mode though, and the road rules are difficult to track as the timer stops running if you go over your previous time.
- The game does track things like billboards and jumps, but I think that's too much hassle. The regular events are all clearly visible on the map and easy to find, and there are already a lot of locations.
- Unlocking a car gives you the ability to use it if it is in your garage. There is no way I know of to grant yourself a car without playing on a completed file or using mods, which I have not personally tried.
- Getting a new license resets all completed events. There is no good way of noting this in-game, so use the tracker to find events.
- Except for the burning routes, the vanilla game does not put any requirements on any events.
- To limit the size of sphere 1, the six major areas of the map will be locked behind maps. You can still drive there and complete events that finish there, but you cannot (logically) start events that begin in other areas.
- I may also logically lock certain location types behind additional items, e.g. road rules may require an item to complete. I don't think I will want regional event type locks though, i.e. "Races in Downtown Paradise only". I'm OK with relatively few locking items / large spheres as this game is very open-world and the events are not especially difficult.
